### `Latest`
# **Version 1.7**
This update includes a refresh to Cumulus. You will find new colors have been added along with new fonts and design elements. Other additons include overall bug fixes and improvements to better your experience when retreiving forecast data. I hope you all like the refresh. With the Dark Sky API being shutdown soon an alternative is in the works. This new data source will be used in Cumulus 1.8. Development of Cumulus for the Apple Watch is in the early stages and will be released soon after!
