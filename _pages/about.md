# About
I first got the idea for Cumulus back in 2017. After trying out other numerous weather apps and not finding one I liked, I decided to build my own. I was a self taught developer that was ready for the challenge of building a large project that I had never built before,  so I took the plunge. Before I started the development of Cumulus my goal was to create a weather app that had a simplified interface that didnâ€™t make users feel overwhelmed with ads or forecast data. I wanted to create something where users felt they could rely on the data being given to them while not having to spend money on a subscription or pay to even download it. From the start Cumulus has always been self funded and developed by a one man operation. My focus has always been about creating something that is unique. I hope that someone finds it to be useful and reliable to check their local weather. If you have any questions about myself, my app, or just want to chat, please feel free to reach out.
