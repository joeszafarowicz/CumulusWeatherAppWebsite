# Privacy Policy
From the start Cumulus has always been self funded and developed by a one man operation. My goal has always been about creating something that is unique and doesn't track users or sell their data. Your privacy matters most to Cumulus which is why it is built to not include any personally identifiable information and does not store any of that information on servers. I hope that someone finds it to be safe, useful, and reliable to check their local weather.

# Privacy 
Cumulus takes your privacy and personal data seriously. Cumulus will only retrieve the least information that is necessary. Individual users are never tracked and personal data is never given to third parties.

<br>

# Location Information
You may opt to grant Cumulus access to your location to receive localized weather forecasts. Cumulus does not require access to your location however some of its features do. For the most accurate weather forecasts location permission is recommended but is not required. You can enable location access by selecting to allow location access "While Using the App" or "Always". You can always change the location access on your devices' settings.

# Information Collection
Cumulus does not collect or store any personally identifiable information. Cumulus may ask for permission to access your location but this can be changed at anytime under your devices' settings and is not required. When you allow location access to Cumulus, your location is used along with the Dark Sky servers to retrieve weather forecasts for your location. Your location is also used when the today widget or Siri shortcuts are enabled. Your location is only used each time a request is made. None of the information sent is personally identifiable or stored by any third party.

# Subcriptions
Some features of Cumulus are only accessible through a subscription basis and billed according to the subscription. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic cycle. Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or yearly basis, depending upon the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a subscription. \n\nYour subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of your subscription period unless canceled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of current period. \n\nYou can manage your subscription or turn off auto-renewal at any time from your iTunes account settings. Cancellation of the active subscription period is not allowed.

# Analytics
Cumulus does not use any third party services for analytics. However, it does utilize Apple's App Analytics platform to collect statistics on app crashes and usage. This information helps to diagnose and resolve any issues when encountered. This data is collected anonymously and cannot be used to personally identify users.
