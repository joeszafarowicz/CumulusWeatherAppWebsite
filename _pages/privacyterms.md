# Privacy Policy
From the start Cumulus has always been self funded and developed by a one man operation. My goal has always been about creating something that is unique and doesn't track users or sell their data. Your privacy matters most to Cumulus which is why it is built to not include any personally identifiable information and does not store any of that information on servers. I hope that someone finds it to be safe, useful, and reliable to check their local weather.

# Location Information
You may opt to grant Cumulus access to your location to receive localized weather forecasts. Cumulus does not require access to your location however some of its features do. For the most accurate weather forecasts location permission is recommended but is not required. You can enable location access by selecting to allow location access "While Using the App" or "Always". You can always change the location access on your devices' settings.

# Information Collection
Cumulus does not collect or store any personally identifiable information. Cumulus may ask for permission to access your location but this can be changed at anytime under your devices' settings and is not required. When you allow location access to Cumulus, your location is used along with the Dark Sky servers to retrieve weather forecasts for your location. Your location is also used when the today widget or Siri shortcuts are enabled. Your location is only used each time a request is made. None of the information sent is personally identifiable or stored by any third party.

# Analytics
Cumulus does not use any third party services for analytics. However, it does utilize Apple's App Analytics platform to collect statistics on app crashes and usage. This information helps to diagnose and resolve any issues when encountered. This data is collected anonymously and cannot be used to personally identify users.
